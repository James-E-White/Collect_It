# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
   # comics = Comic.create([
   # {title: 'Superman', issue: 305, publisher: 'DC Comics'},
   # {title: 'Batman', issue: 405, publisher: 'DC Comics'},
   # {title: 'Wolverine', issue: 1, publisher: 'Marvel'},
   # {title: 'Iron Man', issue: 202, publisher: 'Marvel'},
   # {title: 'Fantastic Four', issue: 305, publisher: 'Marvel'},
   # {title: 'Spawn', issue: 12, publisher: 'Image'},
   # {title: 'Spider-Man', issue: 300, publisher: 'Marvel'},
   # {title: 'Pitt', issue: 2, publisher: 'Image'},
   # {title: 'Battlechasers', issue: 22, publisher: 'Image'},
